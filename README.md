# Phial [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/roshakorost/Phial.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#roshakorost/Phial)

**Phial is an Android library created to simplify communication between QAs and developers.** When bug happens Phial allows to share logs, screenshot, system and build data from a device to developers for simplifying debugging and fixing.

Debug data can be easily extended by using `Key-Values` or providing custom `Attachers`.

Why use it: 
- Quickly dump all needed debug data from the device and share it with developers.
- No need to manually capture screenshots.
- The more recent the snapshot the more valuable the data is.
